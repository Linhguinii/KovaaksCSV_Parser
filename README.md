This is a personal project I started during quarantine.
To stay connected with my friends during this difficult time, I started playing games with my friends; the main game that I played was Valorant, a new game by Riot Games. Compared to other games, like League of Legends, a moba game, there is a simple way to improve in Valorant, or FPS games(First Person Shooters). You can by improving your aim using aim trainers such as Kovaaks or AimLab. Therefore, to make sure I can see my progress visually or know that I am improving, I made a program that would read the score in the csvfile created by Kovaaks and calculate the average, so I can make a graph on Excel and see if I'm proving through a trendline.
